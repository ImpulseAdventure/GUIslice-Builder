## Brief Overview
The GUIslice Builder is a standalone desktop application that is more than a layout tool for your UI. It's designed as 
Low Code GUI Generator for User Interfaces that make use of GUIslice API. 

The cross-platform utility includes a WYSIWYG graphical editor that enables drag & drop placement of UI elements. Once a GUI has been laid out, the Builder can then generate a fully functional GUIslice Graphical UI complete with plug-in points for your custom application. 

The GUIslice API framework code can handle hardware like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32 and more. It supports Graphic libraries like 
Adafruit's GFX, M5Stack, TFT_eSPI and LINUX with a wide variety of TFT Display Drivers and combinations of Touch support chips.

The generated output code (*.c, *.ino, *_GSLC.h) includes all of the necessary defines, UI storage elements and initialization 
in addition to the placement of the UI elements. This will greatly improve the ease in creating a new Graphical Application.

## Release History

### Hot Fix 0.17.b04
- Issue `#184` GUIslice Builder crash when changing Minimum Value at Ramp Gauge

### Enhancements for 0.17.b03
- Issue `#147` Allow multiline text for text button
NOTE: Sizing of a Text button using multiple lines of text is the users responsiblity. You will need to set 
the height and width manually.  Ending each line inside the Label with \n. Example, "line1\nline2\nline3".
The Builder will remove each \n and replace with a decimal 10 (newline) when you press enter key.

### Hot Fix 0.17.b02
Yet another fix for critical Log4Shell vulnerability inside Apache Log4j. The vulnerability applies 2.0 to 2.15.0 of Apache Log4j.  

### Hot Fix 0.17.b01
Fix for critical Log4Shell vulnerability inside Apache Log4j. The vulnerability was publicly disclosed via GitHub on December 9, 2021. Versions 2.0 and 2.14.1 of Apache Log4j have been impacted.  

### Enhancements for 0.17.0
GUIslice 0.17 added improved support for external inputs such as physical buttons, encoders or pins. Users can now 
traverse and edit most widgets in the GUI using external inputs. This feature required minor changes to Builder. 
Some elements now require a slightly larger margin around them (ie. 1px) to accommodate a potential focus frame. 
For example, between a slider and the listbox.

Added support for UTFT library using Target Platform "utft". Full native font support for fonts downloaded from 
[UTFT Fonts](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/r_fonts.php). Simply download and drop them into GUIsliceBuilder/fonts/utft.
The Builder ships with the UTFT DefaultFonts (SmallFont, BigFont, and SevenSegNumFont) installed.
See User Guide section 5.7 Adding Fonts for more details.

### Bug Fixes for 0.17.0
- Issue `#175` Inserting a unicode character into text field caused crash
- Issue `#174` Crash when input non-ascii chars when you first didn't change to font that supports unicode.
Note you still must select an appropiate font before enterring characters or they will appear as blanks. 
- Issue `#174` Crash when deleting a base page.
- Issue `#174` Crash if you are inside color chooser and click on blank space inside recent colors box.
- GUIslice discussion -> xTextBox - writing to a specific character position `#392`.  Setting a Grid positions minor or major to a width or height of zero caused crashes. 

### Enhancements for 0.16.0

With this release the Builder becomes a true WYSIWYG editor for most platforms. The Builder now reads and parses 
your actual Platform Font header and c files and renders them inside the Builder. This native font support will now 
be able to give you accurate sizing and positioning information for supported fonts. Plus your text will be now 
displayed exactly as it will appear on your target TFT display. 

The Native Font support includes, Adafruit's Builtin GLCD fonts, and Adafruit's GFX compatable fonts, and 
Teensy ILI9341_t3 fonts. This Native Font support includes the ability to add your own fonts to the Builder 
simply by dropping them into the proper folders. You may also tell the Builder to simulate fonts it doesn't directly support. 

See the User Guide for more information about font handling and how to add your custom fonts.

GUIslice API 0.16.0 has upgraded the Keypad support. This is a breaking change for the API so the Builder 
will now require running with GUIslice API 0.16.0 and higher. For further information on keypads 
refer to the wiki page [Custom KeyPads](https://github.com/ImpulseAdventure/GUIslice/wiki/Custom-KeyPads)

The Builder has added support for ctrl-Z for Undo and ctrl-Y for Redo.
