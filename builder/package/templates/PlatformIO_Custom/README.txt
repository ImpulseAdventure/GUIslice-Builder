  Place any custom PlatformIO configuration environments
  in this folder.  
	
	You can copy any files inside templates/PlatformIO_Config 
	into this folder and edit them. Any files in this folder 
	will take precedence over those inside PlatformIO_Config 
	folder so you won't need to delete them from the 
	PlatformIO_Config folder.
	
	Also any files found here will be shown first in the
	Project Options tab "PlatformIO default_envs" property
	ComboBox pull-down.
	
	Keeping your custom configurations here will allow you to update
	versions of GUIsliceBuilder without having them deleted during a
	new install.
