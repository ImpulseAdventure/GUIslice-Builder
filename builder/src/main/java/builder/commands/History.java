/**
 * The Class History implements undo and redo functionality.
 * <p>
 * To make commands undo-/redoable We maintain two stacks, one for for commands
 * available for undo and one for commands available for redo.
 * </p>  
 * <p>
 * Every command executed is required to call History.push() with the command in question.  
 * This command is then placed on our undo stack and we clear the redo stack.
 * </p>  
 * <p>  
 * Each Command Object will have one internal Memento Object. The memento will have saved 
 * the “original” state of any objects required to restore the project back before  
 * a command was executed. Thus, to undo any command we simply pop it off the
 * undo stack and call command.restore() method which is actually implemented 
 * by the internal memento object held inside the command.  This will cause all 
 * objects involved to rollback to they're previous state.
 * </p>  
 * <p>
 * Redo is supported simply by pushing a command onto the redo stack on each undo
 * operation.  If a redo is asked for then a command is pop'ed off the redo
 * stack and the command is told to execute().  This works because each command
 * object is required to store any data needed for execution inside the command object, 
 * before changing any objects by the execute() method.
 * </p>
