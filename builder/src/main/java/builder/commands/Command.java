/**
 * The Class Command.
 * Base class for the Command Pattern.
 * <p>
 * The pattern intends to encapsulate in an object all the data required 
 * for performing a given action (command), including what method to call, 
 * the method's arguments, and the object to which the method belongs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, instead of following this pattern exactly, it will be extended
 * by storing Memento objects that will contain data for undo'ing and
 * redo'ing commands.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This model allows us to decouple objects that produce the commands
 * from their consumers, and will give users the ability to undo and redo
 * operations.
