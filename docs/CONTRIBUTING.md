# Contributing to GUIsliceBuilder
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:
Please keep in mind that we are working part-time on this project so try to keep each new pull requests as close to a single new feature as possible.  
This will greatly reduce our work load in reviewing your request.
 
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs or behavior, update the README.md documentation.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

### Describe the bug
*Please describe what you observe on the display or any error messages*

### Device hardware
- *MCU*: ??? ATmega2560, ESP32, etc.
- *Display with link*: ??? Adafruit ILI9341 2.8" resistive (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1651)

### Checklist to try first
*Most display/touch issues can be identified by working through the steps in the [Configuring GUIslice](https://github.com/ImpulseAdventure/GUIslice/wiki/Configuring-GUIslice) guide.*

*Please confirm whether:*
- *Display works correctly with standalone display driver library examples (eg. TFT_eSPI graphicstest, Adafruit graphicstest, etc.) without GUIslice:* ???
- *Touch works correctly with standalone touch library examples without GUIslice:* ???

### Expected behavior
*A description of what you expected to happen*

### Initialization messages
